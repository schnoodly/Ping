# About Ping

The focus is user-friendly. The essential idea is quick communication, event set-ups, and improving quality of life socializing.
I made this being sick and tired of taking ages to find updates through social media, as the algorithms try to cram in more and 
more content that is of no benefit to me. I actually just want to be able to use this between my friends and I as a means of not 
needing to rely on certain social media's clunky systems of gatherings and events.

Ping is set to be a messaging/meetup/social app that aims to eliminate the congestion in current "social media" 
applications that try to hand feed content that may or may not be wanted. Cutting down to minimal aspects of 
socializing, this app will feature:

	-Contact availability status (such as Busy, DnD, Doing X, Watching Movies, Emergency only, etc)
	-send a quick "ping" to any one/group of contact(s) where you can provide or request several sets of 
	information like:
		-Current Location Request
		-Available to Call/Text/etc.
		-ETA
		-Send Destination, place, or event
		-Schedule deadline/meetup time etc.
	-Organization of group events one time, recurring, or constant
	-Give local suggestions for places/events to hang out/eat/etc at
		-Theoretically this could allow businesses to promote events or specials in non-intrusive ways.

It may seem unnecessary, but think of the number of times you know someone is probably available, just not on a 
specific platform. Ping hopes to elimninate these situations by eventually being available on every platform, being 
able to communicate between any device whilst carrying conversation, set up plans, and more.
